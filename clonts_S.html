        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This keynote speech explores the intersection of ancient yogic wisdom and contemporary artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on mindfulness as a bridge between these fields. It examines the philosophical and ethical imperatives of ancient traditions alongside the functionalities of contemporary AI technologies. Drawing from more than 15 years of research on intermedia practices and the international project <em>Well-Being with Arts</em> at Kyushu University, the speech delves into the performative aspects of Art-Yoga and its impact on well-being.</p>
        
        <p>Ancient texts like the <em>Patanjali Yoga Sutras</em> and the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> provide a structured epistemological system integrating metaphysics, ethics, and self-realization, foundational to many contemporary mindfulness practices. The enactive approach, rooted in biology, neuroscience, Mahayana Buddhism, and phenomenology, highlights the cognitive relevance of embodied experiences, challenging traditional notions of self and cognition.</p>

        <p>The concept of autopoietic machines, as defined by Maturana and Varela, is applied to both mindfulness practices and generative AI, emphasizing their self-sustaining and regenerative nature. The integration of AI into mindfulness practices offers enhanced accessibility, support for mental health, and augmented learning environments, while raising ethical concerns about human interaction, technostress, and the illusion of agency.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, this speech aims to expand our understanding of self-awareness, well-being, and existential inquiry, fostering individual and collective mindfulness through the convergence of ancient philosophies and new technologies.</p>
